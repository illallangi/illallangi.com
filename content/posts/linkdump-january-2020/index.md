## Capture the Flag

\n\n\n\n

After my success at the Capture the Flag event at Cisco Live 2019, we’ve started training in advance for Cisco Live 2020\. Starting by working through picoCTF, which is a free CTF created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University.

\n\n\n\n

## Geography

\n\n\n\n

Not likely to be a regular fixture in my linkdumps, but an interesting article on the update of the GPS coordinate system in Australia:

\n\n\n\n

\n\n\n\n

## Kubernetes

\n\n\n\n

Two very different approaches for the same task, writing a Kubernetes operator.

\n\n\n\n

\n\n\n\n

## Aviation

\n\n\n\n

On the back of the continuing dramas with Boeing’s 737-MAX aircraft grounding comes a children’s storybook about an airplane that couldn’t fly. Teaches children about airports and pushing through adversity, apparently.

\n\n\n\n

*   [Max, the Airplane that Couldn’t Fly](\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/109657120X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=viefrothewin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=109657120X&linkId=047a44508c6aae451ec2ad00fcb2c57a\")

\n\n\n\n

I ordered a KerberosSDR after reading this article, hoping to start listening in to air traffic communications around Melbourne soon.

\n\n\n\n

*   [Using a KerberosSDR to Monitor Air Traffic Control Voice, Ads-B, Acars & vdl2 Simultaneously on a Raspberry Pi 3b+](\"https://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-a-kerberossdr-to-monitor-air-traffic-control-voice-ads-b-acars-vdl2-simultaneously-on-a-raspberry-pi-3b/\")

\n\n\n\n

Although I could just save all the expense and hassle and use LiveATC.net to listen in to the Melbourne area, but what sort of a geek would I be if I did that?

\n\n\n\n

\n\n\n\n

## Networking

\n\n\n\n

Troubleshooting various NBN connections over the phone, the variety of Network Termination Devices (NTDs) in use in the different connection methods results in a bit of a headache.

\n\n\n\n

\n\n\n\n

Does Gigabit Ethernet have a half duplex option?

\n\n\n\n

## Automotive

\n\n\n\n

Coveted my neighbours switch panel during my trip to Ayers Rock last year. Was seriously considering getting one of these for the Miata, until I saw the price.
