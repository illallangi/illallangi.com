The ABC asks [does 2020 mark the beginning of a new decade or do we have to wait until 2021?](\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-31/when-do-the-20s-start/11831444\")

This was a pet peeve of mine in 2000\. All the people calling it the start of a new millenium drove me nuts. Clearly the math said 2000 was the last year of the second millenium, not the first of the third.

\n\n\n\n

I can’t remember hearing much about it either way in 2010, but for some reason it’s come back with a vengeance in 2020\. I’m hearing a lot of talk about “Good riddance 2010” – I don’t think a lot of people particularly enjoyed this decade and are keen for it to end.

\n\n\n\n

I think I’ve grown up a bit since 2000 – I don’t really care any more if people want to call it the new decade or not. I think I tend to agree with [Professor Noel](\"https://blogs.commons.georgetown.edu/hansnoel/curriculum-vitae/\") on this one:

> Knowledge is knowing that there was no year 0, so technically, the new decade begins Jan. 1, 2021, not 2020\.  
>   
> Wisdom is knowing that we started this system in the middle, it's socially constructed anyway, and it feels right to treat "1 to 10" as a decade, so that's what we do.

And of course XKCD has an opinion:
